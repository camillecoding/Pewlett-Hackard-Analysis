# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

This project entailed working with SQL to evaluate employees who reached or were nearing retirement eligibility. My client aimed to use this information to future-proof the organization. Knowledge management and succession planning is a key component of ensuring that an organization can prepare for a present and future workforce. 

##Overview ##

In the first level of analysis, I generated several CSV files according to different retirement metrics, usually sorting by the unique employee identifier.

## Results ##

There are several key takeaways from this project. The first level of analysis indicates that the organization will lose a sizeable portion of their engineering and senior-level employees. While senior-level staffing employees will likely be successding by support staff being promoted into these positions, the organization must ensure that these employees are engaged through effective training and development. This will also be true for engineering staff.
