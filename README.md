# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

This project involved using SQL to evaluate employees who reached or were nearing retirement eligibility, as determined only by the employee's birth date. Several text files were joined in a new table to reduce the extraneous information that wouldn't add to my analysis. My client aimed to use this information to future-proof the organization. Knowledge management and succession planning is a key component of ensuring that an organization can prepare for a present and future workforce. 

## Overview ##

In the first level of analysis, I generated several CSV files according to different retirement metrics, usually sorting by the unique employee identifier.

## Results ##

There are several key takeaways from this project.  

* Mentorship alone will not replace the wave of retiring employees unless the mentorship eligibility requirements are expanded. According to the existing criteria, only existing employees who were born in the year 1965 which results in a total of 1,549 employees. Eligibility should be expanded according to junior-level job titles.

* Over 130,000 are retirement eligible. Initiatives must be enacted to ensure that knowledge management efforts are executed swiftly before institutional knowledge is lost.

* Unsurprisingly, the majority of retirement-eligible employees are in senior-level positions. These senior employees leaving the organization will likely require the company to occur additional expenses in the form of pension payments, healthcare payments, severance packages, and more. The company must prepare short- and long-term strategies that will maintain stability for existing employees and the future workforce.

* Inherently, evaluating these data required some assumptions. One of the assumptions is of a "silver tsunami" itself, and that the majority of the staff who are considered retirement eligible plan to retire in the near future. There are other considerations in retirement, one being the assumption that an employee is financially prepared to sustain themselves in retirement (or has an effective financial stability plan in place. This is not guaranteed, and retirement-aged employees in the United States tend to work later in life than previous generations. If the company is prepared to incentivize these employees, this can be a mutually-beneficial opportunity to prepare younger generations in the workforce, collect more institutional knowledge from senior employees, and allow these employees to reap the financial benefits associated with the active workforce.


## Summary ##

This analysis aimed to prepare this client for a wave of potential upcoming retirements. It generalized things like common retirement age, although this could be more accurately informed by evaluating national economic conditions along with company-wide historical retirement data.

Two queries that would make this analysis more effective would consider tenure with the company as informing retirement decisions and categorizing potential retiring employees by department so that departments could better prepare. 

## Final Tableau Story ##

I returned to this project to create a Tableau Story to illustrate more of the insights I found in this data. [Review my synopsis of Pewlet Hackard Retirement Insights here.](https://public.tableau.com/shared/JWR4XB5R2?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
